  <h1>⛯ Inscription of Saint Elira Virelle</h1>

  <p>
    Here lies <strong>Saint Elira Virelle</strong>, Flamebearer of the Kindled Mercy,<br>
    Mercy’s Last Witness, Keeper of the Emberlight, and Shepherd of the Condemned.
  </p>

  <p>
    She who wept for the wicked and burned for the innocent.<br>
    Whose flame did not falter, even when cast into the deep.
  </p>

  <p>
    By her breath, the fire of Ignis Solara endured.<br>
    By her silence, a hundred sins were pardoned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let none forget the warmth she gave, nor the light she was denied.<br>
    And should her name pass your lips — do so with clean hands and a lit heart.
  </p>
