*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

---

## 🧩 Overview

The Soul-Drinker Idol is a twisted relic of divine and necrotic energies—once a symbol of mercy, now defiled through betrayal, sacrifice, and spiritual rot.

Forged from stone, bone, and enshrined sorrow, the Idol pulses faintly with the souls of those lost during the flooding of the cathedral—**most notably Elira herself**. It is both **a container of divine memory** and **a parasitic ward** that fuels its own defense.

---

## 🧠 Role in the Adventure

- Anchors Elira’s fractured soul  
- Must be **sealed** or **absorbed** to resolve the final act  
- Interacts with the sealing ritual, resisting purification  
- Reacts to key names spoken (Elira, Ennius Cauldran)  
- Can be destroyed *only if properly sealed first*

---

## 🧬 Properties

While attuned to the Idol (willingly or unwillingly), the bearer gains:

- **+1 AC** and **resistance to necrotic damage**  
- Can speak and understand **Celestial** and **Abyssal**  
- Can cast *Speak with Dead* 1/day, but only hears **echoes of regret**  
- When making death saves, rolls **2 dice and chooses one**

---

## 💀 Cursed Nature

The Idol is cursed. Once attuned:

- You **cannot unattune** unless *Remove Curse* or *Wish* is used  
- Each dawn, roll a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw**:
  - **Fail:** Lose 1 hit die as a soul fragment is drained  
  - **Succeed:** Feel Elira’s sorrow—but retain control  
- When another soul dies within 30 ft., it is **pulled into the Idol** (unless protected by divine blessing)

---

## 🧊 Soul Capacity

The Idol contains:
- 🧬 **Elira Vaust** (primary soul, unstable)
- ⚰️ **6–10 common souls** of townsfolk, pilgrims, and clergy
- 💥 May release a **soul burst** if damaged: 3d8 necrotic + stunned for 1 round

---

## 🧨 Destruction

- Cannot be destroyed by conventional means  
- Must be:  
  1. Sealed using Elira’s name  
  2. Bathed in divine light  
  3. Buried beneath **true stone of the cathedral**  
- Upon destruction, all bound souls are released and pass on—except Elira, who speaks once before fading

---

## 📜 Read-Aloud Description (When Found)

> The Idol is cold, but sweat beads on your palm.  
>  
> Bone-fused stone, coiled with warped metal and tangled scripture.  
>  
> Its surface writhes faintly. Not movement—*memory*.  
>  
> A face, half-formed, tries to look back.
