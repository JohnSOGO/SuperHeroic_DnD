<h1>Sunken Cathedral – Room Narration & Encounter Guide</h1>

<h2>Main Nave</h2>
<p>You step into the cathedral’s grand nave. Pews, once polished and orderly, now list beneath inches of stagnant water. Arched supports groan overhead. Motes of light flicker through fractured stained glass.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Main congregation hall for sermons and community gatherings.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> 1 Drowned Clergy patrols silently.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> None.</p>

<h2>Hall of Saints</h2>
<p>You enter a long corridor lined with statues of forgotten saints. Most are broken, their faces gouged out. One figure remains intact: a woman with an outstretched hand and a missing nameplate.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Honoring past saints and clergy.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> None, though saying Elira’s name triggers a magical weeping effect.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> None.</p>

<h2>Scriptorium</h2>
<p>The door creaks open into a room of collapsed shelves and mold-rotted parchment. This was once a place of study and transcription. Now it smells of mildew and soaked ink.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Copying holy texts and maintaining historical records.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Loud noise may cause further ceiling collapse (Dex save DC 13).</p>

<h2>Sacristy</h2>
<p>Hinges whine as you enter a side chamber where vestments rot on rusted racks. Silver thread glints dully in the dark, and a broken mirror reflects your approach with warped edges.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Storage of ceremonial robes and sacred items.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Locked chest triggers radiant glyph trap (Wis save DC 13).</p>

<h2>Reliquary Vault</h2>
<p>A sealed door gives way with effort, revealing a small chamber lined with shattered display cases. Relics lie in disarray, bones and crystal fragments strewn across the floor.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Protected storage of saints’ relics.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> 1 Sanctified Shell animates if relics are disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> None, but vision-inducing relics may distract players.</p>

<h2>Baptismal Pool</h2>
<p>This room smells of decay and lichen. The central font is cracked and filled with dark water that ripples even in still air. Fungus clings to the walls in sickly yellow hues.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Ritual baptisms and spiritual cleansing.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> 1 Toiling Shade may rise if the pool is entered or disrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> None.</p>

<h2>Choir Loft (Collapsed)</h2>
<p>A rickety wooden staircase leads to a partially collapsed loft. Above, broken floorboards and a shattered choir railing remain as echoes of solemn music long silenced.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Space for choir and music during services.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Climbing risks falling debris or slipping (Athletics check DC 12).</p>

<h2>Clerical Quarters</h2>
<p>You pass through small doorways into a row of narrow rooms. Cots and footlockers lie upturned, and the faint smell of candle wax lingers like old memory.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Sleeping quarters for resident clergy.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> None.</p>

<h2>Sanctum of the Idol (Final Chamber)</h2>
<p>The ceiling expands into a great vaulted space. Water laps at the base of a central dais, upon which rests the body of Elira. Behind her, embedded in the wall like a heart, pulses the Soul-Drinker Idol, exuding sick red light.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Originally a place of divine meditation — now corrupted by the relic.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> 2 Drowned Clergy, 2 Toiling Shades, 1 Sanctified Shell, and the Idol-Fused Horror (if ritual begins).</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Interrupting the relic or ritual may trigger psychic backlash (Int save DC 14).</p>

<h2>Crypt Access Stair (Blocked)</h2>
<p>You find a staircase leading downward, but the path is caved in. Scratched stone along the wall seems deliberate: “She is not below, but between.”</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Access to deeper crypts and burial vaults.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Further collapse if dug into (Con save DC 15 to avoid damage).</p>

<h2>Bell Tower Base</h2>
<p>Rubble fills the corners of this circular base. Above, a broken spiral staircase reaches into shadow. Wind moans faintly through a shattered bell frame overhead.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Bell ringing and lookout point.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> One undead form clings silently to the rafters, triggered if more than one enters.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Loose stones on entry (Dex save DC 12 to stay quiet).</p>

<h2>Whispering Vestry (Optional Room)</h2>
<p>Silence falls like a blanket the moment you enter. Voices do not echo. Magic feels thinner here. Even your breath sounds distant, absorbed by the padded stonework.</p>
<p class="note">Purpose: Private meditation and confession.</p>
<p><strong>Encounter:</strong> None — unless a shade is brought in from outside.</p>
<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Verbal components fail here — no spells with speaking.</p>
