*“To silence the Idol, you must speak the name she could not.”*

---

## 🕯️ Purpose

The ritual is meant to **cleanse and seal the Soul-Drinker Idol**, binding Elira’s fragmented soul and ending its spread of spiritual corruption.  
It is dangerous, sacred, and requires **the united efforts of three participants**—each fulfilling a symbolic role.

---

## 📜 Requirements

- **Elira’s Body or Ashes** (found in the submerged sanctum)  
- **Elira’s Holy Symbol** (retrieved from Brother Trannic or reliquary)  
- **Her True Name**, spoken in reverence (requires insight into her story)

---

## 🧙‍♀️ Roles

Each player must take one role in the ritual:

| Role | Action | Save Required |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 🔥 The Flamebearer | Holds and lifts the holy symbol during the invocation | DC 14 Constitution save (resist psychic backlash) |
| 📖 The Confessor | Speaks Elira’s full name and reads her final rite | DC 15 Wisdom save (resist doubt and despair) |
| 🕊 The Binder | Physically places the relic on the coffin or bones | DC 16 Charisma save (resist soul tethering)

---

## 🌀 The Ritual Flow

### 🧭 Step 1: Circle of Light
- The area must be cleansed with radiant or divine magic (any light-based spell suffices)
- Enemies nearby will attempt to disrupt or mock the rite

### 🎙 Step 2: Speak the Name
- “Elira Vaust. Child of Mercy. Saint of the Drowned.”  
- Must be spoken with belief. Falsehood breaks the flow.

### 🔒 Step 3: Final Placement
- The holy symbol is pressed against her bones or coffin  
- The Binder must pass a **DC 16 Charisma saving throw** or be pulled into the Idol’s memory storm

---

## ⚠️ Failure Conditions

- If **any 2 saves fail**, the sealing **collapses** and the Idol **awakened** fully  
- If **all 3 fail**, Elira’s soul is shattered permanently, and the Idol becomes **uncontainable**
- If **only 1 fails**, the ritual completes, but **one player is marked by Elira’s sorrow**

---

## ✨ Completion Effect

If all succeed:
- The Idol turns to ash, and Elira’s spirit appears  
- She thanks the players before fading in peace  
- Undead nearby collapse, and the cathedral lights briefly with divine warmth

---

## 🎭 Read-Aloud Flavor (During Ritual)

> A shimmer moves through the air like heat. The symbol glows white-red.  
>  
> Elira’s name echoes across stone—spoken with reverence for the first time in decades.  
>  
> Something begins to scream… then weep… then nothing.  
>  
> A single bell chimes, though none are left hanging.
