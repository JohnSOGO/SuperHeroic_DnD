# The Kindled Mercy

## Overview
The Kindled Mercy is a divine order devoted to **Ignis Solara**, the Radiant Flame—goddess of purification, justice, creativity, and fire. Rooted in the belief that light must burn away corruption but preserve the soul, the Kindled Mercy operates as both protectors and creators, much like their goddess. Their creed centers on mercy through transformation and salvation through radiant purpose.

## Creed of the Kindled Mercy
- **Light the Way:** Be the beacon that others follow in darkness.
- **Burn Away Corruption:** Use fire not for wrath, but for purification.
- **Forge Unity:** As flame melds metal, bring people together.
- **Protect the Innocent:** Shelter those who cannot defend themselves.
- **Pursue Excellence:** Improve yourself and elevate others through creation and discipline.

## Temples and Worship
Temples are open-air sanctuaries, housing an **eternal flame** on a bronze altar. Robes of white, gold, and orange mark the Kindled Souls—the clerics and paladins of this order. Sacred rituals include the creation of radiant artifacts and the *Pyre of Eternal Flame*, a rite that purifies the undead into **Solara Diamonds**.

## Holy Symbol
A sunburst enclosed in a teardrop, With gentle flame motifs curling upward.
The symbol represents both mercy and radiant purification — central themes of the Kindled Mercy order.

## Role in Your Campaign
The Kindled Mercy appears in **The Drowned Saint** as the religious order that Saint Elira belonged to before her tragic martyrdom. Though the order declined after her death, echoes of its teachings and symbols remain in Vellbridge, especially at the *Sunken Cathedral* and in the minds of surviving clergy like **Brother Trannic**.

## Connection to Ignis Solara
The Kindled Mercy embodies Ignis Solara’s balanced philosophy: the flame both heals and purifies. Many of their relics, including the **Emberforge Reliquary**, come from her divine spark and are used to craft *Solara Diamonds*, gemstones that heal the living and damage the undead.

## Character Hooks
- **Chris:** As a cleric with deep theological knowledge, Chris can identify relics of the Kindled Mercy and may receive divine visions in sacred locations. His connection to this order can help navigate the Sunken Cathedral and unlock blessings.
- **Corona Firebrand:** A Kindled Soul carrying the Emberforge Reliquary, she acts as a divine emissary from Ignis Solara, tasked with crafting Solara Diamonds and enacting divine cleansing of corrupted ground.

## Future Use
The Kindled Mercy can be revived by the players. If the relics are restored, the shrine reignited, or the memory of Elira honored through the sealing ritual, the order may rise again. New Kindled Souls may be anointed, and players could become champions of Solara’s light in future adventures.
