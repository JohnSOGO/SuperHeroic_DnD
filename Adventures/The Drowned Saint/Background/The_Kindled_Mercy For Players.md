# The Kindled Mercy

## Overview
The Kindled Mercy is a divine order devoted to **Ignis Solara**, the Radiant Flame—goddess of purification, justice, creativity, and fire. Rooted in the belief that light must burn away corruption but preserve the soul, the Kindled Mercy operates as both protectors and creators, much like their goddess. Their creed centers on mercy through transformation and salvation through radiant purpose.

## Creed of the Kindled Mercy
- **Light the Way:** Be the beacon that others follow in darkness.
- **Burn Away Corruption:** Use fire not for wrath, but for purification.
- **Forge Unity:** As flame melds metal, bring people together.
- **Protect the Innocent:** Shelter those who cannot defend themselves.
- **Pursue Excellence:** Improve yourself and elevate others through creation and discipline.

## Temples and Worship
Temples are open-air sanctuaries, housing an **eternal flame** on a bronze altar. Robes of white, gold, and orange mark the Kindled Souls—the clerics and paladins of this order. Sacred rituals include the creation of radiant artifacts and the *Pyre of Eternal Flame*, a rite that purifies the undead into **Solara Diamonds**.

## Connection to Ignis Solara
The Kindled Mercy embodies Ignis Solara’s balanced philosophy: the flame both heals and purifies.
