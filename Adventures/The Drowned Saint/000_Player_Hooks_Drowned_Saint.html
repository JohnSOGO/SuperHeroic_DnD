<h1>ðŸŽ¯ Player Hooks: The Drowned Saint</h1>
<p><em>All players know each other and are drawn to Vellbridge by fate, belief, or shared consequence. These are their personal reasons â€” whether they share them aloud is up to them.</em></p>

<div class="hook">
  <h2>ðŸª¦ Aloquin â€“ Soul Shepherd of the Deathwarden</h2>
  <p>You have felt a tremor in the ledger of the dead. A great soul, once bound in grace, is fading â€” not ascending. The Deathwarden whispers of a distortion: <strong>Elira is weakening</strong>, and the <strong>Soul-Drinker Idol</strong> hungers for a new well of power. You are sent to release her soul, or consume what remains in her place.</p>
</div>

<div class="hook">
  <h2>ðŸ›¡ Chris â€“ Plasmoid Cleric of the Living Flame</h2>
  <p>In dreams, you have seen a woman of flame drowning in dark water. You awoke with your ooze glowing â€” a beacon, you suspect, left by Elira herself. Her flame is flickering, but not gone. If it dies, so may your divine connection. You are drawn to <strong>restore the ember</strong> and protect what remains of her light.</p>
</div>

<div class="hook">
  <h2>ðŸ—¡ One-Shot â€“ The Shadow Who Hunts</h2>
  <p>You were hired to retrieve a "lost relic of divine memory" hidden beneath a sunken chapel. Your contact warned: <em>"Do not touch it with bloodied hands."</em> You werenâ€™t told what the idol does, only that it must be removed before it feeds again. You also suspect the bounty has more to do with you than with money...</p>
</div>

<div class="hook">
  <h2>ðŸ•¯ Shared Prophecy</h2>
  <p>On the road, all three of you encountered the same withered seer â€” a faceless figure who said nothing, only handed each of you the same burned scrap of parchment:</p>
  <blockquote>
    "When the light drowns and the idol drinks again,<br>
    Only three hands may seal the breathless flame."
  </blockquote>
  <p>You never spoke of it to each other. But each of you carries that same scrap.</p>
</div>
