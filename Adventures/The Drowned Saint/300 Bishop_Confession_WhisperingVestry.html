<h1>📜 Whispering Vestry – The Bishop’s Final Confession</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>🎭 DM Script: What the Players Experience</h2>
  <div class="quote">
    The vestry is unnervingly silent. Even your footsteps sound distant, swallowed by stone and shadow.  
    On a simple wooden bench, beneath a cracked iron wall sconce, rests a leather-bound journal wrapped in a strip of priestly sash.  
    As you open the book, the air seems to tighten — as if the room is listening.

  <h2>📖 Items Found in the Room</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Bishop’s personal journal, scorched along one edge</li>
    <li>A broken signet ring engraved with the name <strong>Ennius Cauldran</strong></li>
    <li>Wax-sealed envelope, never sent, addressed to “Mother Solara”</li>
    <li>A Kindled Mercy rosary twisted into a loop — several beads shattered</li>
    <li>An empty vial labeled <em>“Mercy’s Silence”</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📝 Journal Entry – Final Confession of Bishop Ennius Cauldran</h2>
  <div class="quote">
    I knew her light would spread too far. Elira saw healing in pain, mercy in blood. I saw only threat — that she would eclipse me, and call down judgement on the rest of us.  
    <br><br>
    I lied. I forged the vision. I whispered to the Arch-Clerics that she had grown proud, that she would betray her vows.  
    <br><br>
    But it was I who betrayed the vow. I feared the flame she carried. I feared that her mercy would reveal the rot in our bones.  
    <br><br>
    I gave the order. I watched them seal her away beneath stone and prayer, and I said nothing.  
    <br><br>
    Now the Idol speaks to me. It knows what I did. It feeds on the truth I buried.  
    <br><br>
    If there is forgiveness, it must come from her lips. But she is gone, and I — I have no right to rise.  
    <br><br>
    May this room, this silence, carry my confession to whatever gods still listen.
