<h1>☀️ Radiant Immunity – DM Script & Lore Justification</h1>

<h2>📜 DM Read-Aloud Script</h2>
<div class="quote">
  <p>Your spell flares with holy brilliance, a blast of radiant light searing through the sanctified air —</p>
  <p>— and then... nothing.</p>
  <p>The creature stands unbothered, bathed in the glow, its form unmoving. The light crackles and disperses like it’s been swallowed.</p>
  <p><strong>“That light no longer touches us,”</strong> a voice whispers, <strong>“we remember its warmth... but we serve deeper truths now.”</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>🔍 Lore Reason: Why Are These Creatures Immune to Radiant?</h2>

<p>Based on <strong>The Drowned Saint</strong> narrative and character files (<em>SuperHeroic DnD.pdf</em>, <em>Elira’s lore</em>, <em>statblocks</em>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>These undead were once part of the <strong>Kindled Mercy</strong> – Elira’s holy order dedicated to radiant healing and mercy.</li>
  <li>After Elira’s betrayal and burial, many clergy <strong>renounced the light</strong> or were twisted by grief and guilt.</li>
  <li>Exposure to the <strong>Soul-Drinker Idol</strong> warped them into undead forms that <em>reject the divine light</em>.</li>
  <li>They are no longer harmed by the radiance they once wielded — their souls have become <strong>numb to grace</strong>.</li>
  <li>Symbolically, this makes them <strong>immune to radiant damage</strong> — light is now meaningless to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧠 Tips for Players</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the player asks why, Chris or Aloquin may recognize that <strong>“they were once of the light… and now they’re beyond it.”</strong></li>
  <li>One-Shot might notice that even shadows flicker off them unnaturally — they are <em>unanchored</em>.</li>
  <li>Encourage alternate tactics: necrotic, fire, weapons, physical traps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🎭 Narrative Meaning</h2>
<p>This twist reinforces the story of spiritual corruption — not just physical decay. The undead are not merely monsters. They are <strong>burned-out saints</strong>, numb to the very light that once guided them.</p>
