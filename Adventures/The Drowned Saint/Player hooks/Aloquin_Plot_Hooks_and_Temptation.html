    <h1>Aloquin’s Role in “The Drowned Saint”</h1>

    <h2>Plot Hooks Specific to Aloquin</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Counted Dead:</strong> Aloquin has freed 311 of the 1,021 required souls. The Soul-Drinker Idol presents a major opportunity—dozens, perhaps hundreds of souls are trapped within.</li>
        <li><strong>Village Echoes:</strong> The haunted moans within the Idol resemble those Aloquin heard in the ruins of Vensborough, drawing painful memories—and hope of redemption.</li>
        <li><strong>Deathwarden’s Voice:</strong> The patron may speak directly to Aloquin near the Idol, compelling or warning him depending on his actions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Pact with the Deathwarden</h2>
    <p>Aloquin is bound to a sacred pact: release 1,021 defiled souls to free his family and find peace in death. Until then, he rises after every death. His very existence is a walking reminder of his purpose—and failure.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Consequence:</strong> If Aloquin tries to absorb the Idol for power or delay judgment, the Deathwarden may curse him further—or sever the pact entirely.
    </div>

    <h2>How the Idol Tempts Aloquin</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Power:</strong> The Idol could give him a shortcut—release all souls at once by absorbing them through a devastating act of sacrifice.</li>
        <li><strong>Despair:</strong> Voices from the Idol whisper of futility, urging Aloquin to take the burden alone and use the souls to burn away evil preemptively.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Echoes:</strong> One voice in the Idol may sound like his younger brother Casrin—possibly an illusion or a soul truly trapped.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Optional Souls for Release</h2>
    <p>The Idol contains over 100 trapped spirits, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The original Order of the Kindled Mercy (Elira’s companions)</li>
        <li>Defiled townsfolk of Vellbridge</li>
        <li>Corrupted clergy who repented too late</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choices During the Adventure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Seal the Idol:</strong> Elira is freed, and Aloquin adds all 100+ souls to his tally. He gains favor with the Deathwarden.</li>
        <li><strong>Absorb the Idol:</strong> Aloquin consumes the Idol, gaining a massive temporary power boost. He adds the souls to his count, but suffers torment, permanent scars, and alienation from his patron.</li>
        <li><strong>Destroy the Idol:</strong> All souls are released indiscriminately. Aloquin adds some souls (roll randomly) but risks corruption and divine backlash.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DM Note:</h2>
    <p>This adventure is Aloquin’s crossroads. The Idol is a crucible—not just for Elira’s fate, but for Aloquin’s legacy. Use divine visions, voices in dreams, or flashes of past trauma to draw him deeper.</p>
