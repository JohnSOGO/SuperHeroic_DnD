    <h1>☠️ One-Shot's Kill Poems</h1>
    <p><em>To be spoken dramatically or mischievously whenever One-Shot uses Assassinate.</em></p>

    <div class="poem">
        “A blink, a breath, a blade to bone—<br>
        You should’ve stayed inside your tomb.”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “You shambled, moaned, you reached to bite—<br>
        I whispered ‘nope’ and snuffed your light.”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “One step, two steps, you turned your head—<br>
        Too late. You’re missing it. (Your head.)”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “Rotten ribs and stinking soul—<br>
        I poked a hole. You’re not whole.”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “You were a priest, or so they said—<br>
        Now you’re just a pile of dread.”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “With silent toe and steady aim—<br>
        I end your cursed, forgotten name.”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “Undead or not, you have a spine—<br>
        I borrowed it. It’s now mine.”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “You hissed, you missed, I kissed your fate—<br>
        My dagger’s faster than your hate.”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “Rest in peace? You didn’t earn it—<br>
        I helped. You’re welcome. Don’t return it.”
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        “I counted steps, I held my breath—<br>
        I whispered poetry... and death.”
    </div>
