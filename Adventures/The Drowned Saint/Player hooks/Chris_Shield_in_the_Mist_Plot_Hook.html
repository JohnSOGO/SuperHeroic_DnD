  <h1>🛡️ Chris Plot Hook: The Shield in the Mist</h1>

  <p>Inside the submerged cathedral lies a crumbling chamber — sealed behind a heavy stone door perforated with holes. A steady stream of pale-green mist leaks out, reeking of rot and sanctified decay.</p>

  <div class="quote">Only a creature immune to poison and able to change shape could slip through alive. Only Chris can make the attempt.</div>

  <h2>🔐 Entry Conditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The wall is solid stone with hand-sized bore holes.</li>
    <li>The room beyond is filled with acidic divine mist (poison damage to non-resistant creatures).</li>
    <li>Chris can ooze through safely due to his plasmoid nature and poison resistance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛡️ Shield of the Forgotten Vow</h2>
  <p>Inside, resting atop a broken altar, is a half-melted shield engraved with the sigil of Brother Seril — a warrior-priest who tried to stop Elira’s ritual drowning but was cast aside.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When touched by Chris, the shield partially reforms.</li>
    <li>With <strong>Mending</strong>, the shield becomes usable.</li>
    <li>Once per long rest, Chris may automatically succeed on a <strong>Shield Master shove or block</strong>.</li>
    <li>The shield hums with divine tension. In the presence of the Idol or the bishop’s ghost, it begins to whisper Elira’s name — or scream.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💧 Ichor in the Air</h2>
  <p>The mist is not just poison — it’s sacred. Chris can condense a vial of <strong>Elira’s sanctified ichor</strong> from the air, usable in the final ritual:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Can be poured on the Idol to weaken its defenses (disadvantage on saving throws against sealing)</li>
    <li>Can be used as a one-time radiant weapon, dealing 3d8 radiant damage to undead</li>
    <li>But collecting it leaves a fragment of Elira’s sorrow inside Chris (DM's discretion)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎭 Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>This chamber and its contents are <strongonly accessible to Chris</strong>. His unique physiology and shield mastery allow him to retrieve tools and relics no one else can — and face a haunting echo of the past.</p>
