  <h1>📘 The Hidden Assassin’s Codex</h1>

  <p>Deep within a collapsed confessional of the cathedral, One-Shot uncovers a small, leather-bound book — stitched together from veiled prayers and black market vellum. It is the <strong>Codex of the Hollow Veil</strong>, a hidden manual for divine assassins who once worked in secret for the clergy.</p>

  <div class="quote">
    “To kill without sound, to wound the soul, to silence what should not rise.”
  </div>

  <h2>🧠 Only for One-Shot</h2>
  <p>The Codex only reveals its contents to a trained assassin. As soon as One-Shot touches it, glyphs glow faintly and rearrange into a readable format only she can see. Her rogue instincts feel an almost eerie familiarity, as if this knowledge was waiting for her.</p>

  <h2>📜 What It Reveals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Secret notes on how the <strong>clergy used assassins</strong> to eliminate heretics — including dissenters from Elira’s order.</li>
    <li>Names scratched out, but one chapter is titled: <em>“The Girl They Couldn’t Bury.”</em></li>
    <li>Details on anti-undead pressure points and ritual bindings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💀 Ritual Kill Technique: <em>Sever the Unquiet</em></h2>
  <p>Once per long rest, One-Shot may invoke this technique when making a melee or ranged weapon attack against an undead creature:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bonus Action:</strong> Whisper the Codex’s death phrase ("Vellum fades").</li>
    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a <strong>DC 13 Constitution saving throw</strong> or be:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Staggered until the end of its next turn (disadvantage on all attacks and checks)</li>
      <li>Unable to cast spells that require verbal components for 1 round</li>
    </ul>
    <li>On a critical hit, the creature is also <strong>turned for 1 round</strong> as if by a Turn Undead effect.</li>
  </ul>

    “Undeath fears silence. Strike the word from their breath.” — Codex of the Hollow Veil
  </div>

  <h2>🎭 Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>This Codex gives One-Shot a way to interact meaningfully with the supernatural in this adventure. It ties her skills as an assassin directly into the lore of Elira’s downfall — and may grant her the unique ability to disrupt the Soul-Drinker Idol’s defenses, or protect the ritual team when it matters most.</p>
