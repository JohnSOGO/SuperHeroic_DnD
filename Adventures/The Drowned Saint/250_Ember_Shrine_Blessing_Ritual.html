<h1>✨ The Ember Shrine of Elira</h1>

<p><em>“A flame that never yields. A whisper that sanctifies steel.”</em></p>

<h2>📍 Location</h2>
<p>Hidden beneath a collapsed apothecary near the drowned cathedral is a fractured shrine — once tended by Elira’s order. A scorched altar rests atop a cracked marble plinth, beneath which a copper brazier glows faintly through layers of soot and ash.</p>

<h2>🧠 Chris’s Cleric Knowledge</h2>
<div class="box">
  As a cleric and plasmoid, Chris instinctively recognizes this shrine as one of Elira’s last true sanctified sites. The ember within is not mundane fire — it is a <strong>fragment of divine flame</strong>, preserved through centuries of drowning rot. Chris recalls the ancient rite of <em>Sanctum Ignis</em>, used to bless relics and purge corruption.
</div>

<h2>🔧 The Blessing Rite (3 Steps)</h2>
<p>The party may perform this rite to bless one weapon each. Chris automatically understands the proper flow of the ritual, reducing the difficulty and guiding others.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Ignite the Ember</strong> – Chris removes the ash with reverence. He must speak a prayer or guiding verse to rekindle it.<br><em>Skill: Religion (Chris, DC 11)</em></li>
  <li><strong>Anoint the Blade</strong> – Each player dips their weapon in the flame after applying water or ichor.<br><em>Skill: Sleight of Hand (One-Shot, DC 13) or Survival</em></li>
  <li><strong>Speak the Vow</strong> – Each character recites a vow of purpose or penance aloud, invoking Elira’s mercy.<br><em>Skill: Insight or Persuasion (DC 13)</em></li>
</ol>

<h2>✅ Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each blessed weapon counts as <strong>magical</strong> for 24 hours (or one long rest).</li>
  <li>The first time it hits an undead, it deals an extra <strong>1d4 radiant damage</strong>.</li>
  <li>Optional: The weapon glows faintly near corrupted relics or during the sealing ritual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>❌ Failure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the ritual is rushed or fumbled, the flame shrieks and a <strong>Drowned Clergy</strong> animates from the ash.</li>
  <li>Defeating it allows the flame to stabilize and grants the blessing with reduced power (no radiant bonus).</li>
</ul>

<h2>🎭 Roleplay Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chris</strong> sees a vision of Elira kneeling in prayer, her voice hoarse but unbroken.</li>
  <li><strong>Aloquin</strong> feels one of his burdened souls whisper “Stay the blade…” before fading.</li>
  <li><strong>One-Shot</strong> hears a ghostly child’s voice: “Do it quick. Like always.”</li>
</ul>

<div class="box">
  <strong>DM Tip:</strong> Let Chris’s leadership during the ritual reduce one roll’s DC by 2 for each other player.
