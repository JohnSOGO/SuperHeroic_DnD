*‚ÄúHe was once the Bishop‚Äôs shadow. Now he keeps the candle lit for ghosts.‚Äù*

## üßî Who Is Brother Trannic?

Brother Trannic is a surviving monk of the Kindled Mercy order. Once a scribe and loyal servant to Bishop Ennius Cauldran, he abandoned the clergy shortly after Elira‚Äôs death‚Äîtormented by guilt and secrecy.

He now lives as a recluse, tending to forgotten graves and muttering prayers no one else remembers.

---

## üîç How the Players Find Him

- Ask **Widow Marn** about ‚Äúthose who still believe‚Äù  
- **Follow ghostly footprints** leading from the reliquary gate to the overgrown path  
- Discover his **abandoned sermon journals** in the closed seminary archives
- **Random encounter** while camping near the shrine of Lost Hours (he leaves candles)

---

## üß† What He Knows

- The **true name** of the bishop: *Ennius Cauldran*  
- That Elira was not ‚Äúascended‚Äù but **sacrificed alive**
- The **location of the sealed ritual vault** beneath the cathedral
- The **basic structure of the sealing ritual**, and that it requires:
  - **Her symbol**
  - **Her body**
  - **Her final name spoken by another of the faith**

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è How He Can Help

- Perform the **first step** of the sealing ritual, invoking her name  
- Offer the players **Elira‚Äôs preserved holy symbol**, hidden in his robe  
- Lead them through **unmarked crypt paths** only he remembers
- Provide cryptic but useful guidance during combat or haunting

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è How He Can Hurt

- If **convinced the players mock the faith**, he may try to stop the ritual  
- If **possessed or corrupted**, he can lead the players into a false chamber  
- He may **attempt to ‚Äúcomplete the sacrifice‚Äù** himself if Elira‚Äôs soul is unstable‚Äîbelieving it must be finished to end her torment

---

## üé≠ Roleplaying Brother Trannic

- Speaks in soft riddles and fractured hymns  
- Calls Elira ‚Äúthe girl with no funeral‚Äù or ‚Äúthe flame they drowned‚Äù  
- Nervous, apologetic, but increasingly lucid when truth is spoken

## üìú Read-Aloud (First Encounter)

> A man in faded robes kneels beside a headstone too worn to read. He hums a broken hymn, his fingers trembling with age and fear.  
>  
> He turns, startled. ‚ÄúYou came,‚Äù he whispers, as if remembering a dream.  
>  
> ‚ÄúShe waits. Beneath. But she‚Äôs not alone now.‚Äù
