## 🌁 Overview

Vellbridge is a mist-wrapped riverside town built at the edge of a long-drowned valley, just north of the shattered cathedral ruins. Once a thriving pilgrimage site known for its saintly relics and miracle springs, Vellbridge now clings to a hushed existence, layered in secrecy, superstition, and half-buried guilt.

## 📜 Read-Aloud Flavor (Arrival)

> As your boots strike the worn stones of Vellbridge’s outer lane, fog curls between leaning cottages and bowed streetlamps.  
>  
> A bell rings once. Only once.  
>  
> You hear murmured prayers behind shuttered windows—and from somewhere unseen, the echo of water where no river flows.
