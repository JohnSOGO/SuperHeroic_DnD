### 🛐 Out of Combat Behavior

Drowned Clergy are often found kneeling in flooded sanctuaries or ruined chapels, muttering silent prayers, or reenacting ghostly rites with no audience. They may gesture toward altars, mimicking sacraments long since abandoned.

---

### ⚠️ Triggers for Combat

- Approaching sacred altars without reverence  
- Speaking Elira’s name with anger or blasphemy  
- Using radiant magic in a defiled sanctuary

---

### 🎭 Motivation / Purpose

They are priests who clung to faith even as it was twisted. Now corrupted, they seek to force others into false confession, hoping someone will finally atone for the bishop’s betrayal.

---

### 🧮 Number and Role

- Typically appear in **groups of 2–3**  
- Serve as the first major opposition guarding the **cathedral’s reliquary wings**

---

### 📜 Read-Aloud: First Encounter

> Cloaked in tattered vestments, the figure bows silently before a shattered altar.  
>  
> With a crackling breath, it rises—hollow eyes burning from within—and extends both hands in benediction.  
>  
> The air thickens. The smell of burnt incense and blood fills your nose. The Clergy has not forgiven.
