### 🛐 Out of Combat Behavior

Tolling Shades drift silently near:

- **Choir lofts and bell towers**, resonating with broken hymns  
- **Memorial halls** where Elira’s name was erased or denied  
- **Submerged corridors** where she was carried and forgotten  

They mimic **prayers in reverse**, pace as if in mourning, or reflect from still water before appearing.

---

### ⚠️ Triggers for Combat

Tolling Shades attack when:

- A PC **touches Elira’s reliquary** or sacred icon  
- A **radiant spell** lights up the chamber  
- A PC says “Elira” with **mockery or guilt**

---

### 🎭 Motivation / Purpose

Tolling Shades are manifestations of **grief, silence, and denied mourning**.  
They toll not for vengeance, but to **commemorate Elira**, whose death was erased from history.

They seek to:
- Mourn the saint who was never given a funeral  
- Guard the truth of her death from being erased  
- Haunt those who dishonor or forget her sacrifice

> *“You did not weep for her. So we ring. So we echo.”*

---

### 🧮 Number and Role

- **There are 2–4 Tolling Shades** in the cathedral  
- They are **not a swarm**, but **resonant echoes**—each one a different aspect of Elira’s memory
- They may appear in **sequence**, **together**, or even **non-hostile**—until provoked

### 📜 Read-Aloud: First Encounter

> As you enter the crumbled choir loft, silence grows thick—until a faint ringing rolls through the air, as if an old bell tolled far beneath the sea.  
>  
> A pale shimmer appears above a cracked pew, coalescing into a veiled figure, half-woman, half-echo, her mouth moving in prayer… but no sound escapes—only the memory of sound.  
>  
> The temperature drops.  
> Her face turns toward you, expression unreadable, and she begins to hum something only half-remembered.
