In the **Hero System (Champions)**, characters have disadvantages (now called **Complications** in later editions) that allow them to gain additional character points for creating more complex and interesting heroes. These disadvantages help define a character’s weaknesses, flaws, and vulnerabilities.

Here’s a list of common **disadvantages/complications** in the Hero System:

---

### **1. Physical Disadvantages**
   - **Physical Limitation**: The character has a physical weakness or restriction, such as being blind, deaf, or unable to use a particular limb.
   - **Distinctive Features**: The character has an appearance or physical trait that makes them stand out (e.g., glowing skin, obvious cybernetics, or non-human features).
   - **Vulnerability**: The character takes extra damage or has reduced defenses against specific attacks (e.g., fire, cold, or a particular energy type).
   - **Susceptibility**: The character takes damage or penalties over time when exposed to specific conditions (e.g., exposure to water, radiation, or loud sounds).

### **4. Power-Based Disadvantages**

     - **Activation Roll**: The power requires a successful roll to activate.

### **5. Environmental Disadvantages**
   - **Dependence**: The character relies on a particular substance, environment, or energy source to survive or function (e.g., a cyborg needing regular maintenance or a plant-based hero requiring sunlight).
   - **Environments of Weakness**: The character has reduced effectiveness or vulnerability in specific environments (e.g., underwater, in space, or in extreme temperatures).

By taking these disadvantages, players gain more points to spend on enhancing their character's abilities, making these flaws an integral part of balancing the Hero System. These also add depth to the character and create engaging role-playing opportunities.
